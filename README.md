# pymaceutical-challenge
I used the pymaceutical_starter code provided and class examples for plots and statistics and the following additioanl resources: 
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.agg.html
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.last.html
I had originally used the .max() to retrive the last (greatest) timepoint for each mouse, however, the boxplot result did not match the starterpy - as such i updated to retrive the final periods of time series data rather than the maximum number
